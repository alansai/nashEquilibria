"""ModSim Final Project: Nash Equilibria through Simulation

This module contains the simulation code that facilitates runs of multiple classic game theory games (Prisoner's dilemma, Battle of the Sexes, Stag and Hare, and Rock, Paper, Scissors).  The program will generate a matplotlib file (using ternary if rps) illustrating the results of the simulations.  The program is run through the local terminal.

AI Usage: Google AI Mode was asked:
How to install python ternary through the correct virtual enviornment?
My current program currently runs on Python 3.12 (.venv), what should I do to be able to import python ternary without running into problems?
